    <h3>Tell me about it</h3>
    </p>

    <p> This simple and delicious one-pot chicken and rice dish is a must-try for your family, and I am sure it will
        become a staple weeknight meal.<br>
        It is my favorite weeknight meal to prepare because it is super quick and well-balanced!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Small chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 Cup of rice</li>
        <li>1 Medium onion</li>
        <li>2 Carrots</li>
        <li>3-5 Cups of water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of oil</li>
        <li>Seasoning to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make it:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing all your ingredients; this helps speed up the cooking process.<br>
            Wash, peel, and grate carrots and set aside. Do the same with the onion.<br>
            Prepare the rice by rinsing one cup in a colander; this gets some of the starch.</li>
        <li>Add your diced onion with one tablespoon of oil and sauté on medium for a few minutes in a Dutch oven or
            pot.
        </li>
        <li>Add raw chicken chunks and cook until browned about 5-6 minutes. Add the second tablespoon of oil if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Add grated carrots, stir, and after a few minutes, add rinsed rice.</li>
        <li>Mix everything well and add 3-4 cups of water. Your rice should be covered in water – don’t overfill it; it
            will turn into soup.
        </li>
        <li>Simmer on low for 15-20 minutes, checking in and mixing every five or so minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to fluff rice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
