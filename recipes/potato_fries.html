        <li>2 Medium sweet potatoes </li>
        <li>2 tablespoon cornstarch </li>
        <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make it:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425Â°F</li>
        <li>Wash and pat dry the sweet potatoes.<br>
            Either peel the skin or keep the skin on and cut the sweet potato into 1/4-inch fries.</li>
        <li>Place the sweet potato fries in a bowl or container of cold water for at least 15 minutes to remove the
            starch.<br>
            Drain the water and pat the sweet potatoes dry as best you can.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch, salt, garlic powder, and paprika.</li>
        <li>Place the sweet potato fries in a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil.<br>
            Add the cornstarch mixture and toss the sweet potatoes until they are coated evenly.</li>
        <li>Place the sweet potato fries evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.<br>
            Do not overcrowd or overlap the fries. Use two baking sheets if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the sweet potato fries are crispy and golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow the sweet potato fries to cool for a few minutes before serving.<br>
            Serve with your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!</li>
